# ProAim
Javascript top-down shooter. (Pure Js)

To play the game just download the project as zip, extract wherever you want, and just open the index.html with your favourite browser (Except Internet Explorer :D). Also, you can play it on my github pages page for Pro-Aim. (https://eloyrdev.github.io/ProAim/)

The game basics were made in 3-4 days so the code can be a little chaotic. Be aware before reviewing that could be a lot of bad practice. F

FIRST LOAD WILL BE SLOW AS HELL. I'm still working on optimization of game, suggestions are very welcome :D
