0.1 - Game released. Terrible performance on low-spec computers. Incompatibility with Internet Explorer. Minor visual glitches on Firefox.
0.2 - Some minor bugs fixed. Working on performance yet, but it's close to be solved.
0.3 - Performance fixed. Not on its fullest, maybe on low-spec still runs slow, but now it runs much much better.
